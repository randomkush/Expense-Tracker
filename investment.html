                                        easy. The only silver lining is that over long periods, equity has been able to

                                        stop-loss, one places an advance order to sell a stock at a specific price. To

                                        Equity mutual fund schemes predominantly invest in equity stocks. As per current

                                        Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) Mutual Fund Regulations, an equity
                                        mutual fund scheme must invest at least 65 percent of its assets in equity and
                                        equity-related instruments. An equity fund can be actively managed or passively
                                        managed.

                                        In an actively traded fund, the returns are largely dependent on a fund
                                        manager's
                                        ability to generate returns. Index funds and exchange-traded fund (ETFs) are
                                        passively managed, and these track the underlying index. Equity schemes are
                                        categorised according to market-capitalisation or the sectors in which they
                                        invest.
                                        They are also categorised by whether they are domestic (investing in stocks of
                                        only
                                        Indian companies) or international (investing in stocks of overseas companies).

                                        Debt mutual fund schemes are suitable for investors who want steady returns.
                                        They
                                        are less volatile and, hence, considered less risky compared to equity funds.

                                        However, these mutual funds are not risk free. They carry risks such as interest
                                        rate risk and credit risk. Therefore, investors should study the related risks

                                        a long tenure of 15 years, the impact of compounding of tax-free interest is

                                        especially in the later years. Further, since the interest earned and the

                                        and hence their valuation. Furthermore, this heightened interest is unlikely to

                                        these cryptos to hedge against inflation and even the volatility in global stock
                                        markets amid the geo-political, health and economic crisis.

                                        being both considered as a store of value. Furthermore, gold as well as bitcoin
                                        work to be an inflation and volatility hedge. In fact some of the investors are

                                        (last quote as on Coindesk), this translates into a 33 percent discounted price.
                                        As per longforecast, bitcoin may see correction this year and by July 2022 may
                                        hit levels of sub $85000, providing good gains of over 46 percent.

                                        follow the Singapore model and work on ways to curb any fraudulent attempts such
                                        that neither of the stakeholder suffers on account of any illicit act.
